# Example Racket scripts
These are example scripts for the module **Theory of Algorithms**.
The module is taught to fourth year undergraduate students at [GMIT](http://www.gmit.ie).
The lecturer is [Ian McLoughlin](https://ianmcloughlin.github.io).
The best way to execute these scripts is to use [DrRacket](https://racket-lang.org/).
